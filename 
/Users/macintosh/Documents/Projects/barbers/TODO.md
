# TODO: Fix TypeScript Navigation Type Error

## Issue
Type 'FC<LoginScreenProps>' is not assignable to type 'ScreenComponentType<ParamListBase, "Login"> | undefined'.
The navigation and route properties were required but should be optional for React Navigation compatibility.

## Solution
Use `useNavigation` and `useRoute` hooks from React Navigation instead of passing navigation as props.

## Progress
- [x] Task 1: Update LoginScreen.tsx - Use useNavigation hook
- [x] Task 2: Update OnboardingScreen.tsx - Use useNavigation hook
- [x] Task 3: Update RegisterScreen.tsx - Use useNavigation hook
- [x] Task 4: Update ForgotPasswordScreen.tsx - Use useNavigation hook
- [x] Task 5: Update AuthenticationScreen.tsx - Use useNavigation and useRoute hooks

## Completed Changes
All screen components now use:
- `useNavigation<any>()` hook instead of receiving navigation as props
- `useRoute<any>()` hook in AuthenticationScreen for route params
- Removed `LoginScreenProps` and other screen props type imports

The TypeScript error should now be resolved.
